# nutritioUS
COVID-19 made people more mindful of the importance of maintaining their health. Unfortunately, the pandemic has also led to more people working at their screens, without being as mindful of the amount of water and the types of foods they consume. This made us think: how can we encourage people to make healthier choices, yet also make it fun and competitive for them to do so? And thus, nutritioUS was born.

nutritioUS is a website where users track their food and water consumption while competing with their friends. Users set and track their water, vegetables, proteins, and calories consumed in a day and our website's algorithm calculates their Health Score. With this score, users could make groups to compete against their friends and they could also see how they rank out of their other nutritioUS friends that day.
